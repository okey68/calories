Calculate how many calories your body needs to maintain a healthy lifestyle


This script will calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR), or your resting calories intake. This is the amount you should eat if you do absolutely nothing all day, and never move a muscle. 

It will then calculate your suggested daily calorie intake based on the formula: 

BMR * ACTIVITY LEVEL = DAILY CALORIES

**BMR**
Adult male: 66 + (6.3 x body weight in lbs.) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years) = BMR
Adult female: 655 + (4.3 x weight in lbs.) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years) = BMR

**ACTIVITY LEVEL:**
Sedentary:    	    1.2
Lightly Active:	    1.3
Moderately Active:	1.5
Very Active:	      1.7
Super Active:	      1.9
